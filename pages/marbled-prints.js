        <h2>Marbled Prints</h2>

        <p>
          This was the first print in an intended series called Marbled Prints, each representing a marbled object. The screenprinted poster is 
          called Beef and its pattern comes from a steak's marbled fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          To limit the numbers of colors to keep the silkscreen cost down. 
          By using kraft paper with its own color and texture, as well as overprinting 
          the opaque white with a transparent red, more shades could be created.
        </p>
